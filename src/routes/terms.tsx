              relating to these Terms or the Services will be resolved by final and binding individual
              arbitration, except that either party may bring an eligible claim in small claims court and either
              party may seek injunctive or equitable relief for misuse of intellectual property, confidential
              information, or unauthorized access to systems.

              Arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association under its Consumer
              Arbitration Rules. Arbitration may occur remotely, in the county of your residence, or in another
              mutually agreed location.

              arbitration to the fullest extent permitted by law, or representative proceeding.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may opt out of arbitration within 30 days of first accepting these Terms by sending an email to
              support@receipt-one.com with the subject line &quot;Arbitration Opt-Out&quot; and your account email
              address. If any portion of this section is found unenforceable, the unenforceable portion will be
              severed and the remainder enforced to the maximum extent permitted by law.
